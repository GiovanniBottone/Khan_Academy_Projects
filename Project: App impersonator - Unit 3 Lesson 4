## Instructions Unit 3 Lesson 4
Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements that might look like their own SQL.

CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.


/* What does the app's SQL look like? */

/*CREATE a table to store the data*/

CREATE TABLE users(
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    cost INTEGER,
    material TEXT);

/*INSERT a few example rows in the table*/

INSERT INTO users (id, cost, material) VALUES ("1", "20", "satin");
INSERT INTO users (id, cost, material) VALUES ("2", "40", "bamboo");
INSERT INTO users (id, cost, material) VALUES ("3", "100", "granite"); 
INSERT INTO users (id, cost, material) VALUES ("4", "2000", "concrete");
INSERT INTO users (id, cost, material) VALUES ("5", "1050", "wood");

SELECT * FROM users;

/*Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app*/

UPDATE users SET cost = "15" WHERE id = 1;

SELECT * FROM users;

/*Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app*/

DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 3;

SELECT * FROM users;

/* INSERT a new replacement granite order*/

INSERT INTO users (id, cost, material) VALUES ("6", "1000", "granite");

SELECT * FROM users;
