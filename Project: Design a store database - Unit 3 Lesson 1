## Instructions - Unit 3 Lesson 1
Create your own store! Your store should sell one type of things, like clothing or bikes, whatever you want your store to specialize in. 
You should have a table for all the items in your store, and at least 5 columns for the kind of data you think you'd need to store. 
You should sell at least 15 items, and use select statements to order your items by price and show at least one statistic about the items.

/* Create a table with 5+ columns */
CREATE TABLE clothes (ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, clothing_type TEXT, price INTEGER, clothing_matierial TEXT, clothing_style TEXT );

/* Insert 15+ items into the table */
INSERT INTO clothes VALUES (1, "hat", 29, "cloth", "street");
INSERT INTO clothes VALUES (2, "chain", 49, "rose_gold", "street");
INSERT INTO clothes VALUES (3, "watch", 49, "rose_gold", "street");
INSERT INTO clothes VALUES (4, "ring", 29, "rose_gold", "street");
INSERT INTO clothes VALUES (5, "chain", 49, "silver", "street");
INSERT INTO clothes VALUES (6, "watch", 49, "silver", "street");
INSERT INTO clothes VALUES (7, "ring", 29, "silver", "street");
INSERT INTO clothes VALUES (8, "chain", 49, "gold", "street");
INSERT INTO clothes VALUES (9, "watch", 49, "gold", "street");
INSERT INTO clothes VALUES (10,"ring", 29, "gold", "street");
INSERT INTO clothes VALUES (11, "tee", 19, "vintage", "street");
INSERT INTO clothes VALUES (12, "long_sleeve", 19, "tye_dye", "street");
INSERT INTO clothes VALUES (13, "hoodie", 24.99, "grey", "street");
INSERT INTO clothes VALUES (14, "shorts", 19.99, "black", "street");
INSERT INTO clothes VALUES (15, "pants", 24.99, "denim", "street");

/* Use a select statement to order your items by price */
SELECT * FROM clothes ORDER BY price;

/* Show at least one statistic about the items */
SELECT clothing_matierial, AVG(price) AS avg_price FROM clothes GROUP BY clothing_matierial HAVING avg_price >=19;
